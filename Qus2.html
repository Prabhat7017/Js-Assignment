<!-- Qus. What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types with examples. -->

1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are simple, immutable values stored directly in memory.
a) Number

The Number data type is used to represent both integers and floating-point values. JavaScript also supports special numerical values like Infinity and NaN (Not a Number).

    Example: 25, 3.14, Infinity, NaN

b) String

The String data type is used to store textual data. It can be enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) for template literals.

    Example: "Hello, World!", 'JavaScript', `Hello, ${name}`

c) Boolean

A Boolean represents a logical value and can either be true or false.

    Example: true, false

d) Undefined

A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value is considered undefined.

    Example: let x; // x is undefined

e) Null

Null represents an intentional absence of value. It is explicitly assigned to a variable when we want to indicate that it has no value.

    Example: let data = null;

f) BigInt

BigInt is used to store large integers beyond the safe limit of the Number data type. It is represented by adding n at the end of an integer.

    Example: let bigNumber = 12345678901234567890n;

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

Non-primitive data types store references to memory locations instead of actual values.
a) Object

An Object is a collection of key-value pairs where values can be of any type. Objects are used to store structured data.

    Example: { name: "Alice", age: 30 }

b) Array

An Array is a special type of object that stores ordered lists of values. Each value can be accessed using an index.

    Example: [1, 2, 3, 4], ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

c) Function

A Function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. In JavaScript, functions are treated as objects.

    Example: function greet() { return "Hello!"; }

d) Date

The Date object is used to handle dates and time-related operations in JavaScript.

    Example: new Date()
